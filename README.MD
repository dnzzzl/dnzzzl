I'm Denzel Mendez
I build software, break things on purpose to understand them, and sometimes write about it at abcdenzel.xyz.
Based in the Dominican Republic.

Building in public:
🛒 Dominoes — P2P marketplace for DR. ASP.NET Core API + React Native (Expo).
✍️ Blog — Technical writing about systems, software and security.

Stack
Backend:    C# / .NET Core / Node.js
Frontend:   React / Expo / "enough CSS to be dangerous"
Databases:  PostgreSQL / Oracle / SQL Server / MogoDb
Infra:      Docker / GitHub Actions / Linux
Security:   Network analysis, IDS, CySA+ (in progress)

My Coding Rules
Comments: 
   Should be short and sweet, convey as much non obvious information like your decision making, treat it like you're sending a message on the groupchat.
Naming:
   Names should be clear and obvious. Code should read like prose. If you need a comment to explain what processData() does, rename it to what it actually does. 
   Comments are optional when UserAuthenticationService.ValidateCredentials() does what it says.
Frontend:
   Easy, reusable components. UI should get out of the way. I want to feel like I'm putting legos together so I can focus on the stuff that actually matters: auth flows, state management, that one CORS error that's been haunting me for three days, and real-time websockets.
Commits:
   Atomic. One thing per commit. and then try to learn how git bisect actually works.
Dependencies: Own them.
