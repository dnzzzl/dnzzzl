title = 'Ferreteria Detallista LLM Chatbot Case Study'
+++

Earlier in the year, I got to contribute to a case study by helping with the software engineering, consisting on implementing an LLM Agentic AI System with a Chatbot frontend, we did this for a real business in the retail sector and measured it's feasibility. This gave me a real project to sharpen my Langchain claws.

This blog post will soon be written in further detail about building agentic workflows for the LLM to invoke, integrating data sources, and how we tied it all together with a system of webhooks and event handlers.

However, for now, I'll just share a link to the case study, and a screenshot of the system architecture:
