Like learning how to structure a written article properly. Or resume sharpening a dulled skill, re-learning how to write properly for example, excercising that muscle and struggling to spell the word 'excercise' correctly in the process.

This article is a latent argument of the benefits of forming a habit out of doing things that seem challenging. For its sake and to that end we could compile a comprehensive list of those arguments across history and philosophy, Bertrand Russell style, but instead I choose to present only a sample of what were the most memorable for me during my search; since it will make for a more enjoyable experience, to write and hopefully to read as well, I opt out to be the judge of that last claim.

## You gain something

This is the first argument courtesy of [math sorcerer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7stf1B5CYw)
And it is very similar to an argument I've made before myself which is: Even when the task is above you, once you undertake it you might be able to familiarize yourself with it and that will bring you closer to overcoming the task. Even if ever so slightly.

I enjoyed taking the opportunity to expose anyone to math sorcerer who I think is a cool internet personality, and the contagiously niche concept of doing math and getting better at math for its own merit.

## There is something to be said about habit-forming

You know, being exposed to the activities that form the actual physical neural connections in our brain that overtime become more adept at their function, in turn making us better at the task of overcoming difficulty and performing under novelty and pressure. You know, the type of things we all think about everyday.

And to continue making justice to this argument I will acknowledge the slight hint of sarcasm in the paragraph before. But I want to make the case that even if we don't overthink about it for narrative and comedic reasons, we all do precisely that when we practice and get better at anything that you practice and get better at.

And that concludes my 2 cents, or more precisely the two arguments I've presented about why it is beneficial to do something difficult everyday. Trying to get better at something, trial and error almost for its own sake in recognition of the subtle beauty within the process of learning.
